    Fix the error in the dashboard code when filtering by region.
    
    The issue is in the customized_dashboard.py file around line 518, where the code
    is trying to apply styling to a column that doesn't exist in the dataframe when
    certain filters are applied.
    
    Implementation steps:
    1. Add a check before applying the styling to see if the column exists
    2. Use styler.map instead of styler.applymap (which is deprecated)
    3. Make the same fix for both instances of the code
    """
    # Here's the code snippet that needs to be fixed:
    # 
    # OLD CODE:
    # styler.applymap(lambda x: highlight_zeros(x), subset=[catalog_col])
    #
    # NEW CODE:
    # if catalog_col in pivot_data_display.columns:
    #     styler = styler.map(lambda x: highlight_zeros(x), subset=[catalog_col])
    #
    # This change should be made at both line 518 and line 1204 in customized_dashboard.py
